# OrderedList

This extension adds support for ordered lists to the editor. They are rendered as
'ol' HTML tags. Typing '1.' (or any other number and a dot) at the start of a
new line, followed by an enter or a space will create an OrderedList node. These
nodes can also be created through the Ctrl/CMD + â‡§ + 7 keyboard shortcut.
