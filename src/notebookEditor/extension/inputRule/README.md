# InputRule

This is a basic adaptation of the InputRules Plugin from ProseMirror, whose
sole reason of being is the fact that the original one does not allow execution
of InputRules in Nodes that have the 'code' property defined in their spec

It should be used whenever InputRules that must work
inside of these Nodes have to be added
