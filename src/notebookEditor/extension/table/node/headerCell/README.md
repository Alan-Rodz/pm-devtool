# HeaderCell

Tables can have headers for each column, row, or for many columns/rows.

They are differentiated from regular Cells by having a specific color and
having the text inside of them set to bold. Other than that, they are
regular Cells (and hence, the same commands that can be applied to a cell
can be applied to a header).

Table header Cells are defined with th elements, each th element representing
a Header Table Cell.
