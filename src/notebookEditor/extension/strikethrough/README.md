# Strikethrough

This extension allows text to be rendered as ~~striked text~~. If 's', 'del' or
'strike' HTML tags are passed, they will be set as text with the Strikethrough
mark applied to it, as well as any text with a style that includes 'line-through'.

Text typed between two '~' symbols will be get the Strikethrough mark
applied to it.

The 'Cmd + â‡§ + X' keyboard shortcut can be used to apply the mark.
